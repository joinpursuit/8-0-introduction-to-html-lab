    <h1>Sundial </h1> From Wikipedia, the <p><em><i>free</i></em></p> encyclopedia. A <strong>sundial measures time by the position of the sun</strong>.
     The most commonly seen designs, such as the 'ordinary' or
standard garden sundial, cast a shadow on a flat surface marked with the hours
of the day. As the position of the sun changes, the time indicated by the shadow
changes. <p>However, sundials can be designed for any surface where a fixed object
casts a predictable shadow. Most sundial designs indicate apparent solar time.</p>
Minor design variations can measure standard and daylight saving time, as well.
<h2>History</h2> Sundials in the form of obelisks (3500 BC) and shadow clocks (1500 BC)
are <strong>known from ancient Egypt</strong>, and were developed further by other cultures,
including the Chinese, Greek, and Roman cultures. <p>A type of sundial without
gnomon is described in the old Old Testament (Isaiah 38:2).</p>The mathematician
and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia (ca. 160 BC-ca. 100 BC) is said to have
invented a universal sundial that could be used anywhere on Earth. <p>The French
astronomer Oronce Fine constructed a sundial of ivory in 1524.</p> The Italian
astronomer <p>Giovanni Padovani published a treatise on the sundial in 1570, in
which he included instructions for the manufacture and laying out of mural
(vertical) and horizontal sundials.</p> Giuseppe Biancani's Construction instrumenti
ad horologia solaria discusses how to make a perfect sundial, with accompanying
illustrations. <h2>Installation of standard sundials</h2> Many ornamental sundials are
designed to be used at 45 degrees north.<p> By tilting such a sundial, it may be
installed so that it will keep time. However, some mass-produced garden sundials
are inaccurate because of poor design and cannot be corrected.</p>
