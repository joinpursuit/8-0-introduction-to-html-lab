    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A waffle is a dish made from leavened batter or dough that is cooked between two plates that are patterned to give a characteristic size, shape, and surface impression. Waffles are cooked until they become golden-brown in color, with a crispy outer texture and a soft interior.There are many variations based on the type of waffle iron and recipe used.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup almond flour</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons melted butter</li>
        <li>2 eggs separated </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar </li>
        <li>zest of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>juice of half the lemon, 2 tablespoons</li>
        <li>pinch of salt</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>fresh berries</li>
        <li>whipped cream</li>
        <li>fresh mint leaves</li>
    </ul><hr>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a pan, drop the both the flours, sugar, lemon zest and salt. Give it a whisk. Then, add the egg yolk, melted butter, lemon juice, milk and whisk until the batter comes together to form a smooth consistency.
        </li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, drop the egg whites and whisk until it forms a firm peak.</li>
        <li>Put the whisked egg white into the batter bowl and using a rubber spatula, gently fold the mixture.</li>
        <li>Depending on the kind of waffle maker that you are using, this step will differ. Preheat your waffle maker and ladle the batter into each compartment without overflowing it. I use T-fal SW6100 waffle maker and it requires about ¼ cup of the batter for each compartment. Cover the waffle maker and cook until it’s golden brown. Carefully take the waffles off the compartment and place them on a plate.</li>
        <li>Serve the warm waffles topped with some fresh berries or fruits of your choice, fresh mint leaves and whipped cream or syrup.</li>
