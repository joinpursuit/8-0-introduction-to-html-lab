    <p>
      This peanut butter sandwich is my favorite sandwich. It has the perfect
      balance of ingredients and looks great when made right.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>2 slices bread, such as rye, whole grain, or sourdough</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons peanut butter, smooth or crunchy</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon jam, or jelly, your choice of flavor</li>
      <li>
        1 tablespoon butter, for pan, plus softened butter or margarine for
        bread
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Prepare peanut butter sandwich using desired jelly or jam. Make sure it
        isn't too runny because the sandwich will be heated and jam could leak
        out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a frying pan to melt 1 tablespoon of butter. Tilt pan so butter
        covers pan evenly. This is key to get a perfectly crispy crust on the
        bread.
      </li>
      <li>
        Butter one side of sandwich. Place buttered-side down in the pan. If
        possible, place a steak weight or bacon press on sandwich so it cooks
        evenly. When one side is golden brown, butter other side. Turn sandwich
        over and place weight back on sandwich. The second side will cook faster
        because sandwich is already heated.
      </li>
      <li>Remove sandwich from pan, cut diagonally and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
