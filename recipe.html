<h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
<li>In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar for 4-5 minutes until light and fluffy. Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the eggs and vanilla. Cream mixture for another 1-2 minutes.</li>
<li>Stir in flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, and salt, just until combined.</li>
<li>In a small bowl, stir together sugar and cinnamon.</li>
<li>If time allows, wrap the dough and let refrigerate for 20-30 minutes.  Roll into small balls until round and smooth.  Drop into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and coat well. Using a spoon, coat for a second time, ensuring the cookie balls are completely covered.  
    <em>*To make flatter snickerdoodles, press down in the center of the ball before placing in the oven. This helps to keep them from puffing up in the middle. *</em>
<li>Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake for 9-11 minutes. Let cool for several minutes on baking sheet before removing from the pan. </li>
<li>Grab a delicious beverage to compliment the best tasting cookie in the world.</li>
