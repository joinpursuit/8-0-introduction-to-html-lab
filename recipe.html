    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      There are many ways to make a vegan cheesecake. We decided to go with the
      most simplest recipe. This creamy, perfectly sweet, smooth and slightly
      tart dairy-free alternative goes perfectly well topped with coconut
      whipped cream!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dates</li>
      <li>Walnuts or Macadamia nuts)</li>
      <li>Cashews</li>
      <li>Coconut milk</li>
      <li>Coconut oil</li>
      <li>Lemon juice</li>
      <li>Agave nectar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add dates to food processor and blend until small bits remain and forms
        into a ball. Remove and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next add nuts and process into a meal. Then add dates back in and blend
        until a loose dough forms – it should stick together when you squeeze a
        bit between your fingers. If it’s too dry, add a few more dates through
        the spout while processing. If too wet, add more almond or walnut meal.
        Optional: add a pinch of salt to taste.
      </li>

      <li>
        Lightly grease a standard, 12 slot muffin tin (as original recipe is
        written // adjust if altering batch size). To make removing the
        cheesecakes easier, cut strips of parchment paper and lay them in the
        slots. This creates little tabs that makes removing them easier to pop
        out once frozen.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next scoop in heaping 1 Tbsp amounts of crust and press with fingers. To
        pack it down, use a small glass or the back of a spoon to compact it and
        really press it down. I found the bottom of a glass works well. If it
        sticks, separate the crust and the glass with a small piece of
        parchment. Set in freezer to firm up.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add all filling ingredients to a blender and mix until very smooth. For
        the coconut milk, I like to scoop the “cream” off the top because it
        provides a richer texture. But if yours is already all mixed together,
        just add it in as is.
      </li>
      <li>
        You don’t need a Vitamix for this recipe, just a quality blender. I
        mixed mine for 1 minute, then “liquified” or “pureed” it until silky
        smooth. If it won’t come together, add a touch more lemon juice or agave
        or a splash more coconut milk liquid as the liquid should help it blend
        better.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. If adding peanut butter, add to
        the blender and mix until thoroughly combined. If flavoring with
        blueberry or caramel, wait and swirl on top of plain cheesecakes
        (optional).
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide filling evenly among the muffin tins. Tap a few times to release
        any air bubbles, then cover with plastic wrap and freeze until hard –
        about 4-6 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once set, remove by tugging on the tabs or loosening them with a butter
        knife. They should pop right out. Our favorite way to devour these was
        with a little more caramel and a touch of coconut whipped cream. But
        they’re perfect as is! Keep in the freezer for up to 1-2 weeks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Optional: You can set them out for 10 minutes before serving to soften,
        but I liked them frozen as well.
