        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Grilled cheese is a classic American sandwich that has been around since 1920.
                It is a hot sandwich made with buttered and toasted bread and originally filled with American cheese,
                but is now commonly made with one or more different cheeses.

                <li>2 slices ½”-thick Pullman or other white bread</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons mayonnaise</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
                <li>2 ounces thinly sliced American cheese or cheddar (about 4 slices)</li>
                <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Butter goes in the pan not on the bread.
                    To ensure golden (not burned) toastiness, the exterior of the sandwich should be slicked with mayo,
                    which has a higher smoke point than butter and possesses the combined browning power of oil and egg yolks.
                    When mayo-slicked bread meets buttered pan, that’s when the magic truly begins.</li>
                <li>Opting for a cheese that melts well is paramount:
                    American is the melting-est cheese there is, but a young cheddar cheese works well too and brings deeper flavor.
                    If you want to go off-script, stick to a soft or semisoft cheese.
                    Their high moisture content means they’re especially adept at turning molten.</li>
                <li>Once the sandwich is in the pan, pressing down with a spatula is helpful for achieving even toasting—and for encouraging bread and cheese to meld together.
                    But don’t be overzealous; this is not a smashed cheese sandwich.</li>
                <li>Cut the sandwich diagonally. It’s official: Sandwiches cut this way actually taste better.</li>
            </ol>
