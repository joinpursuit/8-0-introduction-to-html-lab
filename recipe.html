    <h2>
        Ingredients
    </h2>    
    <ul> 
        <li>
            Tortillas: corn or flour, use your favorite.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cheese: many recipes call for Oaxaca cheese, which can be bought online but is not easily available. When I can’t find it, I substitute it for mozzarella and Monterrey Jack or Swiss cheeses.
        </li>
        <li>
            any type works fine (whipping, heavy or double).
        </li>
        <li>
            it’s used to make the binding cream more fluid. Any type works.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tomatoes: any type works. I highly recommend seeding them which is easy to do.
        </li>

        <li>
            Corn: fresh or frozen corn kernels work fine as long as it’s cooked. If you have leftover grilled or roasted corn it’s great to use here too.
        </li>

        <li>
            Onion: yellow or white. Green onions can also work if that’s all you have.
        </li>

        <li>
            Chile: I use jalapeños (or jalapeno) if I can find them. But any type that you like in your Mexican food works. If you can’t find them fresh you can use canned ones, or even adobo or just ground chile
        </li>
        <li>
            Flavorings: salt (I use kosher), freshly ground black pepper and some dried chile, such as ground ancho or jalapeño.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        Directions
    </h2>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350ºF/180°C.
        </li>
        <li>
            Oil or butter a glass or ceramic dish, about 7x12 inches.
        </li>
        <li>
            Grate the cheeses with a large-holed grater. Or process chunks with the steel blade careful not to turn it into a paste. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Cook corn with onion and chile in a skillet with a little oil over medium/high heat until softened and slightly browned.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat tortillas in an oiled skillet at medium heat until slightly charred, about 10-15 seconds per side. just until they lose their softness and begin to crisp. Alternatively, you can fry them in hot oil until crisp but not too brown. Or in a medium (350°F) oven. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine the binding cream ingredients in a medium bowl or jar. No need to beat them, simply integrate. It doesn’t matter if it’s not super smooth. 
        </li>
     
      </ol>

          <strong>Assembling this dish:</strong>
      
    <ol>
        <li>
            Cover the prepared dish with the tortillas creating a sort of container. Start with the sides and then move to the middle. If using crisp or baked tortillas they will most probably brake a little as you try to cover the dish. That is fine. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Scatter the tomatoes and the shredded chicken on top of the tortillas. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the mix of corn and onion, spreading to cover the chicken.
        </li>
        <li>
            Drizzle the binding cream on top making sure you cover the edges.
        </li>
        <li>
            Top with the grated cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for about 45 minutes, until the top is golden and the cream is quite set. It will still be jiggly as it doesn’t contain eggs. If needed bake a little longer. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Alternative: you can make two layers of each ingredient, lasagna style. Simply divide in half and layer as instructed above.  
        </li>
        <li>
            Serve it with a dollop of Mexican cream (crema Mexicana) or sour cream and avocado slices. Or a green salad on the side. 
        </li>
    </ol>
