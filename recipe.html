    <ul>
        <li>250g mascarpone</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 spoons of sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup of Italian coffee (without sugar)</li>
        <li>Â½ glass of marsala</li>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Seperate the parts of the egg. Egg whites in one bowl and yolks in the another bowl.</li>
<li>Take the white eggs bowl and whip it until it is quite firm.</li>
<li>Whisk the yolks and the sugar until it changes colour and becomes pale.</li>
<li>Add the mascarpone to the yolk and sugar combination. Mix well.</li>
<li>Now gently fold the whipped egg whites into the rest of the mixture until combined. This is the cream for your tiramisu.</li>
<li>Mix the Marsala into the coffee, and dip the lady fingers into the coffee for just a few seconds. You can now start building the tiramisu by placing the damp biscuits at the bottom of your serving glass.</li>
<li>Cover the biscuits with a layer of the cream, then layer with more biscuits then some cream and some cacao powder. Keep repeating this until your glass is full, ensuring the top layer is cream.</li>
<li>Finish your tiramisu with a light</li>
<li>Refrigerate for a few hours before serving, or it can be kept in the fridge for up to 2 days!</li>
